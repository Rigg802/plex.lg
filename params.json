{"name":"PLEX.LG","tagline":"Plex client for LG Smart TV (2013)","body":"# Welcome to PLEX.LG\r\n## A PLEX media client for the LG Smart TV\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at a PLEX client for the 2013 LG Smart TV. I am using the LG-55LA7400 model tv which include HTML5 support for application development. I started development of the application to learn how PLEX media server operates and to provide some more visual candy over what the LG DNLA client provides.\r\n\r\nI have released this to GITHUB after receiving overwhelming support from the PLEX community for my effort so far. Please contact me if you would like to contribute, as there are many improvements to be made, and I only work on this in my spare time.\r\n\r\n****Note: I reserve the right to publish this application to the LG application store.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSimon J.
